## UFO and Bigfoot Sighting Analysis

### Purpose
Geographic comparison of UFO and bigfoot sighting reports in the United States. User will have access to a Tableau desktop and will be able to access full reports through an interactive map of the United States. 

### Features
#### 1. Loading data
* I will read in three data files. One file will be UFO sightings report and location (JSON), bigfoot reports (JSON), and bigfoot report locations (csv).
#### 2. Clean and operate the data while combining them
* I will clean all datasets with pandas. Pandas will also be used to combine the bigfoot report dataset and bigfoot report locations dataset.
#### 3. Visualize/Present your data
* I will be creating a Tableau dashboard of an interactive map of the United States to compare the locations of the UFO and bigfoot reports to see if there is any correlation. User will also be able to click on the report location to review the full report.
#### 4. Best practices
* I will build a custom data dictionary to inform the user of of key terms used throughout the datasets.
#### 5. Interpretation of your data
* Code will be annotated with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, as well as annotations on at Tableau desktop.
